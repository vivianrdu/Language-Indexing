#formatting guidlines for this config file:
#  All sections, keys, or values with multiple words will utilize snake case. The only exceptions are the spider class names.
#  Only language names will be capitalized in the keys. Values may be capitalized depending on what the URI components need

#This config begins with the 'sites' section. Each key in this section will have a value the same as the key, but with '_site' appended
# for each key's value, there should be a section by that same name
[sites]
wikipedia : wikipedia_site
#fake : fake_site

#These are the language codes. Yay! Every language that scraped should be noted here in this section. The pages section of each site will
# leverage this section.
[language_codes]
# English : eng
Sakha : sah
# JÃ¨rriais : nrf
# Quechua : qwe
# Nyungar : nys
# Xhosa : xho

#the spiders section will have a key for every spider, the key should be the name of the site, and the value should be the same
# buth with '_spider' appended. This follows the naming scheme of the spider's python file.
